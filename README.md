# CO2X
Carbon Exchange Token

Introduction
CO2X is a token issued to carbon-negative partners of CMPST, The Compost Coin, for verified greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction actions. The token is designed to provide a transparent and blockchain-recorded method of acknowledging and incentivizing real-world sustainability efforts.

Purpose & Mission
CO2X aims to represent tangible, verified carbon reductions. Each CO2X token corresponds to one ton of CO2e prevented through composting, soil regeneration, or other sustainability initiatives. By tying token issuance to verified actions, CO2X ensures that claims of carbon reduction are backed by real-world impact.

Token Minting & Supply CO2X has an initial supply of 0. New tokens are only minted after an audit confirms verified GHG reductions. This ensures that the token supply is directly linked to measurable environmental benefits.

Burn Mechanism
CO2X includes a burn mechanism to provide an additional layer of accountability. Once a token is burned, it signifies that the claim of GHG prevention has been realized and accounted for, preventing inflation and ensuring the integrity of issued tokens.

Relationship Between CO2X and CMPST
CO2X is issued by CMPST, The Compost Coin, as a reward and verification tool for carbon-negative partners. While CMPST incentivizes composting and soil health initiatives, CO2X serves as a way to track and reward the broader environmental impact of these actions.

Current Development & Future Vision
At present, CO2X operates with basic blockchain functionality, including transactions and burns within the SPL token framework. Future development may introduce expanded verification mechanisms, smart contracts, or enhanced partner tracking, depending on growth, resources, and technological advancements.

Conclusion
CO2X provides a simple yet effective way to acknowledge verified GHG reduction efforts. Issued by CMPST, it supports businesses and individuals working to create a sustainable future. While blockchain integration remains minimal for now, CO2X lays the foundation for scalable and verifiable environmental impact tracking.
